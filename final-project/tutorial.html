                <h4>How To Solve a Nonogram</h4>
                <ol id="tutorial-list">
                    <li>The numbers along the top and left side of the grid are clues.</li>
                    <li>Each number is indicating how many squares need to be discovered in that row/column.</li>
                    <li>For example, the 0 at the top left is telling you that whole column does not have any filled squares.</li>
                    <li>This means that the 0 to the left is also indicating that there are no filled squares in that row.</li>
                    <li>To keep track of which squares do not need to be filled in, mark them with an X using right click.</li>
                    <li>Next lets look at the bottom row marked with the clue, 3.</li>
                    <li>Because the 0 at the top left and the top right are indicating that there are no filled squares in their columns, do you know which 3 need to be filled in?</li>
                    <li>Correct! The three middle squares in the bottom row. Go ahead and fill those in by left-clicking on them.</li>
                    <li>When a row/column has two numbers such as 1 and 2 in the column second from the left, this means there are multiple groups that need to be uncovered in the order that they appear (1 and then 2).</li>
                    <li>In this case, there is a group of one and a group of two in this column.</li>
                    <li>Each group must be separated by a blank square so since we know that the group of two has to be the last two in this column given that we filled out the row of three, we know to fill the square above.</li>
                    <li>This leaves only two options for finding the group of one, either the first or second square from the top but since we know there cannot be any filled squares in the first row, we know it has to be the second square.</li>
                    <li>When you make an incorrect guess the square will flash red.</li>
                    <li>If you make three incorrect guesses, you will lose all of your lives and have to start over.</li>
                    <li>Ready to play? Give it a go! Practice until you're ready and then go unlock some paintings!</li>
